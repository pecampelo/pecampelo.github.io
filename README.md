## Coding Standards

They are collections of rules and guidelines that determine the programming style, procedures, and methods for a programming language.

## Programming Methodologies

It is the approach to analyzing such complex problems, planning for software development and controlling the development process.

#### Procedural Programming
    The problem is broken into blocks that perform one task each, and taken   together they form the whole program. It is suitable for small programs with low-level of complexity.

#### Object-oriented Programming



#### Functiona* l Programming


#### Logical Programming

## System Design approach

#### Top-down / Modular approach

#### Bottom-up Programming

## Understanding the Problem

[ ] Requirement gathering / detailed investigation.
{ } Requirement gathering
    * What is being done?
    * How is it being done?
    * What is the frequency of a task?
    * What is the volume of decisions or transactions?
    * What are the problems being encountered?
    * Some techniques that help in gathering this information are −

    * Interviews
    * Questionnaires
    * Studying existing system documents
    * Analyzing business data
    * System analysts needs to create clear and concise but thorough requirements document in order to identify SMART – specific, measurable, agreed upon, realistic and time-based – requirements. A failure to do so results in −

    * Incomplete problem definition
    * Incorrect program goals
    * Re-work to deliver required outcome to client
    * Increased costs
    * Delayed delivery

* Control Structures
    * Decision Control Structures
    * Selection Control Structures
    * Repetition / Loop Control Structures

* Algorithm
    * A finite set of steps that must be followed to solve any problem
    * Acts as blueprint for coding
    * Assists in debugging
    * Becomes part of software documentation for future reference during maintenance phase

* Flowchart
    * Visual representation helps in understanding program logic
    * They act as blueprints for actual program coding
    * Flowcharts are important for program documentation
    * Flowcharts are an important aid during program maintenance
* Data Flow Diagram
    * Level 0 shows the input and output data for the whole system. Then the system is broken down into modules and level 1 DFD shows data flow for each module separately.


* Pseudocode
* Identifying Patterns
* Identifying Mathematical Operations

Correct Programming Techniques
    * Clarity of Expressions
        * Comparing two values
        * Defining a variable, object or class
        * Arithmetic calculations using one or more variables
        * Retrieving data from Database
        * Updating values in database
    * Simplicity
        * Avoid clever instructions
        * One instruction per task
        * Use standards
    * Portable
    * Efficient
    * Effective
    * Reliable
    * User-friendly
    * Self-documenting
* Identifying modules

    * If data is the most important element of the system, create modules that handle related data.
    * If service provided by the system is diverse, break down the system into functional modules.
    * If all else fails, break down the system into logical modules as per your understanding of the system during requirement gathering phase.

* Proper Identifier Names
    * Use language guidelines
    * Don’t shy from giving long names to maintain clarity
    * Use uppercase and lowercase letters
    * Don’t give same name to two identifiers even if the language allows it
    * Don’t give same names to more than one identifier even if they have mutually exclusive scope
* Comments
    * Prologue to the program to explain its objective
    * At the beginning and/or end of logical or functional blocks
    * Make note about special scenarios or exceptions

* Indentation
* Syntax Errors
* Semantic Errors
* Runtime Errors
* Code Optimization
